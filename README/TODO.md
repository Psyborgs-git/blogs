As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to directly create webpages. However, I can provide you with a sample description and layout that you can use as a starting point to design your webpage. Here's a suggested layout for a beautiful webpage for Beyond Digital IT Services:

Include navigation links for different services like Consulting, Website Development, Mobile App Development, AI Analytics, and Digital Marketing.
Hero Section:

A visually appealing banner image showcasing the essence of digital innovation.
Prominent headline highlighting the unique value proposition of Beyond Digital.
Services Section:

Divide the section into different service categories, such as "Consulting", "Web & App Development", "AI Analytics", and "Digital Marketing".
Include brief descriptions and engaging icons for each service.
Add a "Learn More" button to provide further details.
Testimonials Section:

Display client testimonials to build trust and credibility.
Include client names, company logos (with permission), and their positive feedback.
Portfolio Section:

Showcase a selection of successful projects and case studies.
